# Views — showing the lifecycle as an artifact

Files are the source of truth and the only edit surface. Views are read-only
pictures of those files, published as artifacts when someone wants to *look* at
the lifecycle rather than change it.

Never invert that. A view is regenerated from the files every time; it never
holds state, never becomes the thing people edit, and nothing is ever read back
out of a published view into the spec. The moment a view is authoritative, the
committed chain stops being the audit trail — which is the only thing this
lifecycle is selling.

## When to publish one, and when not to

| Ask | Response |
|---|---|
| "what stage is this in", "is X specified" | answer in the session — one line, no artifact |
| "show me the pipeline", "let me see the spec" | publish a view |
| "what's in flight across everything" | publish the fleet view |
| anything that changes something | edit the file, then offer the view |

Publishing costs a round trip, so do not publish for a question a sentence
answers. Do publish when the answer is a table, a trend, or more than about six
rows of anything — that is when reading it in the terminal starts costing more
than the artifact does.

Say the URL and one line about what it shows. Do not explain that it is
read-only unless asked; it is obvious from the content.

## The four views

**Fleet** — every bound repo: product, current stage, open intents, control band
state, eval pass rate, last spec change. Sorted by attention needed, not
alphabetically: breaches first, then contradictions waiting on a ruling, then
cold starts, then healthy. The point of this view is that a person can stop
reading after the first two rows.

**Spec** — one product's living spec: requirement ids with their EARS text,
status (active / superseded with the forward pointer / withdrawn), grouped by
pattern, with acceptance-criteria coverage and unmapped requirements marked.
Show superseded and withdrawn requirements — dimmed, struck through, never
hidden. A spec that shows only what is currently true is not a record.

**Intake** — the classification of one intent against the spec: which of extend,
refine, duplicate or contradict, and the delta it would produce. For a
contradiction, both requirements quoted in full with the conflict stated in one
sentence, and an explicit line saying nothing has been merged. The ruling still
happens in the session — the view shows what is being ruled on.

**Backlog** — the queue in front of the lifecycle, in priority order, with each
item's status and its Jira state where it has a key
(`references/backlog.md`). It is the one view that may be **rearranged**, and
only because reordering it changes nothing that was agreed: no requirement, no
ruling, no principle, and no claim about the product. Even then it does not
write the file — a published page has no filesystem. Dragging composes the
reordered table and hands it back to paste, so `.claude/sdlc/backlog.md` stays
the source of truth and the only edit surface. Each row carries its own
`start work`, naming that item rather than the list. Sorting by status is a way
of **looking**: while it is grouped, the visible order is not the ranking, so
dragging is disabled and the copy-back withdrawn — a priority order silently
rewritten by a sort is worse than a stale one. A Jira status that could not be
read is drawn as unreadable, never as its last known value.

**Band** — one metric's history against its centreline and sigma limits, the
current point, and which rule fired if any. Cold start is drawn as cold start,
never as a flat healthy line.

## Gathering the data

Read files and `gh`; never invent a number to fill a column. Every field comes
from one of:

```bash
scripts/detect-context.sh                       # binding, stage, runner, overrides
cat .claude/sdlc/spec.md                        # requirements and statuses
python3 ops/ci-failure-rate.py                  # band state, centreline, limits
tail -n 30 evals/history.jsonl                  # eval trend
gh issue list --label sdlc:intent --state open  # this repo's intents
gh search issues --owner OWNER --label sdlc:intent --state open --limit 100
```

A field you could not read renders as an em dash with a reason on hover or
beneath it — `no workflows`, `spec not started`, `not bound`. Never render a
missing value as a zero, a full bar, or a healthy colour. Half the value of the
fleet view is seeing which repos are not measured at all.

## Building the page

Start from `templates/view.html` — it carries the tokens and the primitives, so
views stay recognisably one family rather than four different dashboards.

- Dark only, self-contained, no external assets. Inline everything; the artifact
  sandbox blocks outside requests apart from Google Fonts.
- Semantic colour is separate from the accent: green within band, amber
  unmapped or degraded, red breach or contradiction. The accent is for
  interactive and identifying elements only, never for status.
- Monospace and tabular numerals for ids, paths, counts and percentages;
  requirement ids read as `R42` everywhere, never `#42` or `R-42`.
- Wide tables scroll inside their own container; the page body never scrolls
  sideways.
- Republish the same file path to keep one URL per view per product rather than
  accumulating a new artifact every time someone looks.
