#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Pins how run-checks.sh finds its config, its root, and its change list.
#
# THREE resolutions here were once relative to the working directory, and each
# hid the next:
#
#   1. the DEFAULT --config path, so from any subdirectory the runner said
#      "no config" and stopped - in front of every resolution below it;
#   2. ROOT, taken from `dirname <config>`, which for the default config is
#      `.claude/productizer` - so `./scripts/check-hygiene.sh` in `requires`
#      reported `missing_tool` for a tool that was present and executable, and
#      `policy.output` wrote `.claude/productizer/.claude/productizer/...`;
#   3. --changed, so a path that existed at the repository root was reported
#      as not existing.
#
# TWO THINGS THIS FIXTURE DOES ON PURPOSE, both learned from tests that passed
# while the bugs were live:
#
#   * It runs the BARE invocation - no --config, no absolute paths. A test that
#     supplies an absolute --config skips resolution 1 entirely and then agrees
#     with itself from every directory.
#   * It asserts the VALUE of the root, not merely that runs agree. The wrong
#     root was the SAME wrong root from every working directory, so a pure
#     cross-directory identity check passes on the broken code.
#
#   scripts/fixtures/root-resolution.sh [repo-root]
#
# Exit 0 = every assertion holds. Exit 1 = at least one does not.
