#!/usr/bin/env bash
# req-trailer.sh — the join between a permanent requirement id and the commits
#                  that implement it, and between a requirement and its tests.
#
# The spec already owns the hard half: ids that are never reused and never
# renumbered. What was missing is the other direction. Given R14, nothing could
# answer "which commits built this", and given a commit, nothing recorded which
# agreement it served. The join is one git trailer:
#
#     Productizer-Req: R14,R22
#
# A trailer is the cheapest provenance mechanism there is. It is part of the
# commit message, so it survives clone, fetch, rebase, cherry-pick, format-patch
# and mirroring with no infrastructure at all, and it is queryable with
# `git log --grep` on a machine that has never heard of this repo's tooling.
# There is no database to keep in step, nothing to migrate, and nothing that
# rots when the tool that wrote it is uninstalled.
#
# THE OTHER HALF: COVERAGE IDS.
#
#   A commit says a requirement was built. It does not say it is tested. A
#   coverage id says that, and it is deliberately NOT a second id authority:
#
#     COV_<requirement-id>_<slug>
#
#   For R14 that is COV_ followed by R14 followed by _halts_on_contradiction.
#   This file does not spell a whole one out on purpose. --coverage scans every
#   tracked file in the repository it is pointed at, and this script gets
#   vendored INTO those repositories — a literal example in this header would
#   be read as genuine coverage of a genuine requirement, which is the exact
#   false positive the mode exists to expose. references/traceability.md does
#   spell them out, and says so.
#
#   The requirement id is quoted verbatim inside the coverage id, so a coverage
#   id cannot exist without naming a requirement, cannot be renumbered
#   independently, and stops resolving the moment the requirement it names stops
#   existing. That is the point: it makes an orphan mechanically detectable in
#   both directions — a requirement nothing covers, and a coverage id pointing
#   at a requirement that is gone or superseded.
#
#   Full convention: references/traceability.md.
#
# WHO DID THE WORK: `Assisted-by:`.
#
#   The requirement trailer says WHICH agreement a commit served. It says
#   nothing about who or what wrote it, and on this repository that is not a
#   detail — most of these commits were written by a model.
#
#   The Linux kernel is the only major project that has written the rule down,
#   so this follows it verbatim rather than inventing a house style
#   (Documentation/process/coding-assistants.rst, quoted):
#
#     "AI agents MUST NOT add Signed-off-by tags. Only humans can legally
#      certify the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)."
#
#     "Contributions should include an Assisted-by tag in the following
#      format::  Assisted-by: LLM [TOOL1] [TOOL2]"
#
#     "Basic development tools (git, gcc, make, editors) should not be listed."
#

#
#   THREE TRAILERS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS OURS TO WRITE.
#
#     Signed-off-by   a legal certification of the DCO. A model cannot hold
#                     one, so this script never writes one and never offers to.
#     Co-authored-by  git and every forge resolve it to a PERSON: it takes a
#                     name and an address, it appears in contributor lists, and
#                     it makes a person-shaped claim about the commit. Putting
#                     a model in it is the same false claim as Signed-off-by
#                     wearing a friendlier word, so this script refuses it too.
#     Assisted-by     what is actually true, and the only one written here.
#
#   `--assisted-by` writes the kernel's exact form, `Assisted-by: LLM`, and
#   `--tools` appends the specialised analysis tools the kernel's format allows.
#   The word LLM is the whole identity on purpose: the kernel names no vendor
#   and no model, and a trailer naming a version that will be retired is a
#   provenance record with a shelf life.
#
#   `--authorship` reads the OTHER direction: given a message, it reports what
#   the message claims about who wrote it, and refuses two things — a DCO
#   certification or a co-authorship credit whose identity looks like an agent
#   rather than a person, and an `Assisted-by` that is not in the kernel's form.
#   What it CANNOT do is tell whether a commit carrying no authorship trailer
#   at all was assisted. That is unknowable from the message, so it is exit 4,
#   never a clean bill of health.
#
# MODES.
#
#   --add <ids> --file <msg>   merge the trailer into a commit-message file.
#                              Idempotent: run twice, and the file is unchanged.
#     [--assisted-by [--tools "<t1> <t2>"]]
#                              also merge `Assisted-by: LLM [tools]`.
#   --authorship [--file <msg> | --rev <rev>]
#                              what the message claims about who wrote it.
#   --validate [--file <msg> | --rev <rev>]
#                              every id in the trailer must exist in the spec.
#                              An unknown id is an error that names it.
#   --query <id>               the commits carrying that id.
#   --orphans                  active requirements no commit claims.
#   --coverage                 active requirements no COV_ id covers, plus
#                              COV_ ids naming a requirement that is gone or
#                              superseded.
#
# HOW IT REFUSES TO REPORT A ZERO IT DID NOT MEASURE.
#
#   "0 orphans" reads as a clean bill of health, and four different situations
#   can produce it. They are kept apart and none of them is printed as a zero:
#
#     no living spec                     -> exit 2. Nothing to trace.
#     not a git repository, or git broke -> exit 4. Nothing to trace against.
#     a repository with no commits yet   -> exit 4. No history to search.
#     commits, but not one carries a
#     trailer                            -> exit 4. The mechanism is not in use
#                                          here; coverage is UNKNOWN, not zero.
#
#   Only the fifth case — commits exist and some of them carry trailers — is a
#   measurement, and its report prints the counts it was measured from.
#   The same discipline applies to --coverage: no file could be listed, or not
#   one file carries a COV_ id, are both "cannot determine", not "0 uncovered".
#
# WHAT IT SEARCHES, AND WHAT IT THEREFORE CANNOT SEE.
#
#   --query and --orphans read `git log HEAD` — the full ancestry of HEAD, every
#   parent of every merge included, and nothing outside it. A commit that exists
#   only on another branch, or only on a remote that has not been fetched, is
#   invisible, and its requirement therefore looks orphaned. A shallow
#   clone is worse: it looks like a short history rather than a truncated one.
#   The report always names how many commits it actually walked, so a suspicious
#   answer can be recognised as one. KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md has the rest.
#
# EXIT CODES ARE THE CONTRACT.
#
#   0  ran, and there is nothing to report. Backed by printed counts.
#   1  crashed before reaching a report. Read as undetermined, never as clean.
#   2  bad usage, or no spec / no requirement ids in it — nothing was compared.
#   3  a finding: an unknown id, an orphaned requirement, a dangling coverage
#      id. The run succeeded; what it found did not.
#   4  CANNOT DETERMINE. Not a pass, and not a zero.
#
# It never suppresses stderr. An error and a genuine no-match look identical
# once hidden, and telling those two apart is the whole job.
#
# Every date it prints is pinned to UTC. A traceability record whose timestamps
# depend on the reader's laptop is not a record.
