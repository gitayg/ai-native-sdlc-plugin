#                DEFAULT: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, NEVER the working
#                directory. A default of "." resolves to a different store from
#                every subdirectory and answers confidently from the wrong one.
#
# WHAT THIS STORE IS.
#
#   A committed record of things learned about this repo that are NOT
#   obligations. "The build breaks unless X is run first" is an observation
#   about the world; nobody is required to make it true, no test can hold
#   anyone to it, and it has no business in the living spec. The spec answers
#   "what does this system do", and an observation merged into it corrupts the
#   one thing that file is for.
#
#   So learnings live BESIDE the spec and BELOW it. A learning informs; it
#   never obligates and it never outranks a requirement. When one turns out to
#   be a real obligation it GRADUATES to an `R` id and stops being a learning -
#   `graduate` records the transition and the learning keeps its id as the
#   trail from "somebody noticed this" to "the spec now requires it".
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT.
#
#   Not a notes file. A free-text store with no ids, no dates and no ordering
#   cannot tell a current learning from a stale one, so every entry is read
#   with the same weight forever and the store rots into noise nobody trusts.
#   Every learning here has a permanent id, an observation date, and a
#   provenance line naming where it came from.
#
#   Not a second spec. Nothing here is agreed. A learning that CONTRADICTS an
#   active requirement is a finding, not a fact, and goes through intake like
#   any other intent.
#
# UNVERIFIED BY DEFAULT, AND WHY THE CORROBORATOR MUST DIFFER.
#
#   `add` writes `Status: unverified`. It is an observation until something
#   else confirms it. `verify` REFUSES when --by names the same source that
#   observed it: a run that can confirm its own learning promotes whatever it
#   just wrote, and the state means nothing from then on. That refusal is the
#   only thing separating this store from a file of assertions.
#
# STALENESS IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED.
#
#   Age comes from `Observed:`. There is no `stale` field, because a stored
#   flag has to be updated by someone and nobody will. A learning with an
#   unreadable date is reported with an age of an em dash - NEVER as infinitely
#   old, which would bury exactly the entries with the least provenance to
#   recover them by. Dormancy changes presentation only. It never deletes and
#   it never fails a check.
#
# THE ONE THING A PLAIN NOTES FILE CANNOT DO.
#
#   A learning may cite `R14` in its `About:` line, and because ids are
#   permanent that citation stays meaningful for as long as the spec does. So
#   "this learning is about a requirement that has since been superseded" is
#   mechanically detectable, and `check` detects it - the same class of check
#   drift-reverse.sh runs over code, against the same spec baseline, parsed
#   with the same awk pattern.
#
# IT REPORTS BY LOCATION, NEVER BY QUOTING CONTENT.
#
#   A learning is free text a stranger can write, and this output lands in a
#   model's context before a human has read a word of it. Every subcommand
#   emits ids, dates, counts and paths. Not the title, not the observation, not
#   the provenance string. `L7` cannot carry a sentence.
#
# NO FILE MEANS NO COUNT, NOT ZERO.
#
#   Three states, three exit codes, three words, never collapsed into one:
#
#     store absent      never-recorded   count is an em dash   exit 5
#     store unreadable  unknown          count is an em dash   exit 3
#     store empty       empty            count is 0            exit 0
#
#   Only the third is a measured zero. An unmatched glob arrives at bash as a
#   literal path, so the cases are told apart by an explicit directory test and
#   never by trusting a count.
#
# IT NEVER SUPPRESSES STDERR. An error and a genuine no-match look identical
# once hidden, and a store built to be trusted cannot afford that.
#
# EXIT CODES ARE THE CONTRACT.
#
#   0  did the thing; for `check`, a MEASURED clean result
#   1  `check` found at least one finding
#   2  usage - a missing, malformed or unknown argument
#   3  COULD NOT READ an input it needs: the spec, a learning file, or a store
#      directory that exists and cannot be opened. Never confused with 0
#   4  CANNOT DETERMINE - learnings cite requirement ids and the spec carries
#      none, so no citation could be resolved. Not a pass, and not a zero
#   5  the store has NEVER been created. Not an error and not zero: nothing has
#      ever been recorded here, and no count is reported
#   6  REFUSED - a dead requirement cited, a source corroborating itself, an id
#      that does not exist, or an id that already does
