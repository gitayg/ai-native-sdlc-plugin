#   --root DIR         repo the guidance is promoted into. Default: the git
#                      work tree holding the working directory - NOT the
#                      working directory itself. Defaulting to the CWD has
#                      produced four separate silent wrong answers here, each
#                      of which looked like a clean run from a subdirectory.
#                      Outside a work tree there is no default: --root is
#                      required, because guessing is what caused those four.
#   --work DIR         where harvest/draft/journal state lives.
#                      Default <root>/.claude/productizer/graduation
#   --transcripts DIR  root of Claude Code project transcripts.
#                      Default $CLAUDE_TRANSCRIPTS, else ~/.claude/projects
#   --source LIST      comma list of transcripts,pr. Default transcripts
#   --refresh-context  re-run detect-context.sh instead of using the cached probe
#
# THE HUMAN DECIDES. There is no auto-apply flag, defaulted on or otherwise.
# `present` writes nothing outside --work. `apply` refuses without an explicit
# `--decide accept` naming one cluster.
#
# Counting is by DISTINCT CONVERSATION, not by message. Ten repeats in one
# session is one lesson badly received; three across three sessions is a rule.
# The promotion threshold is 3 distinct conversations. That number is here, in
# THRESHOLD_CONVERSATIONS, and nowhere else.
#
# The ladder is prose -> skill -> hook -> ci-gate. Instructions are advisory and
# decay as the context window fills; checks are deterministic and never tire. A
# cluster climbs as high as its evidence justifies and no higher — the rung is
# recommended, printed, and never silently taken.
#
# EACH RUNG ASSERTS A DIFFERENT PROPERTY. Not the same check three times with
# the volume turned up — that is one check, and calling it three is how a ladder
# reports progress that did not happen.
#
#   prose    a line in CLAUDE.md. Asserts nothing. It is read, or it is not.
#   skill    a file under .claude/productizer/graduated/. Asserts nothing
#            either, and says so in its own body; it buys detail and a place to
#            put the evidence, not enforcement.
#   hook     ONE PROPOSED ACTION, judged from the tool payload BEFORE it runs.
#            Reaches text that never becomes a file — a Bash command line is
#            judged here and by nothing else. It never opens a file in the
#            repository and has no denominator.
#   ci-gate  EVERY TRIGGERING FILE IN THE TREE, after the fact, with a declared
#            coverage denominator. Sees the violation the hook never could: one
#            already on disk, edited outside the agent, arriving in a merge, or
#            made by a tool the hook is not registered on. A run that failed to
#            open a file it should have read is a refusal, not a pass — which
#            is the verdict a hook cannot express.
#
# A RUNG IS ONLY OFFERED IF A RULE FOR IT IS WRITTEN. See RULES below. A cluster
# with no rule caps at skill; a cluster whose rule has no `gate` caps at hook.
# The previous version of this file emitted a hook whose body was `exit 0` and a
# checks.yaml entry whose command was the empty string, which is the same defect
# as recording an unmeasured value as a zero.
#
# Clustering is a lexicon, not a model. Every grouping decision is a named
# regex you can read in `graduate.sh lexicon`. A correction that matches no
# topic tag is not guessed at and not dropped: it lands in UNDECIDED and is
# escalated to the human as its own card.
#
# Apply is all-or-nothing and precondition-checked. A create must not already
# exist; an update or remove must match the target file exactly as it was when
# the suggestion was drafted. On any mismatch nothing is written at all and the
# suggestion is flagged, rather than silently clobbering your work. Undo
# restores prior contents, and only if the file still matches what was written.
#
# What this cannot do: it extends a lexicon from corrections people actually
# made. It trains nothing, and it produces precision data only — the corrections
# that WERE voiced. It has no view of the ones nobody bothered to voice, so it
# cannot close a recall gap. See references/graduation.md.
#

#       6  corrections found, none reached the conversation threshold
#       7  apply refused: a precondition failed. NOTHING was written.
#       8  undo refused: a file no longer matches what apply wrote.

The rung below is `skill`: a markdown file under .claude/productizer/graduated/.
It asserts nothing at all. It is advice, it competes for a context window, and
it is followed or it is not - which is the whole reason the ladder exists.

This rung asserts a property of ONE PROPOSED ACTION, read out of the tool
payload BEFORE the action runs, and refuses the action when the property fails.
It therefore also reaches text that never becomes a file: a Bash command line is
judged here and by no other rung."""

GATE_ASSERTS = """WHAT THIS RUNG ASSERTS THAT THE HOOK RUNG BELOW IT DOES NOT

The hook is handed one payload and answers about that payload. It has no
denominator and no memory. A violation already on disk - written before the hook
was installed, edited by a human outside the agent, arriving in a merge, or made
by a tool the hook is not registered on - is invisible to it.

This rung asserts the property over EVERY TRIGGERING FILE IN THE TREE, and it
declares a coverage denominator, so a run that failed to open a file it should
have read is a refusal rather than a pass. `covered 0/1 files` is a verdict
about the check itself, and it is the one thing a hook can never say."""
