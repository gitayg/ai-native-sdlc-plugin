#
# Raises a ruling: writes .claude/productizer/rulings/D<n>-<slug>.md for a
# contradiction, BEFORE the question is asked out loud.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A PARAGRAPH IN A REFERENCE FILE.
#
# `references/rulings.md` specifies "Raising one" in five steps and nothing
# executed them. The lifecycle correctly STOPS on a contradiction, but nobody
# was ever asked for the decision - so the work stopped and stayed stopped, and
# the reasoning that would have unblocked it was never written anywhere. A stop
# that ends in a chat message is the failure this whole lifecycle exists to
# prevent, one layer up. Making the ask mechanical is the only way it cannot be
# skipped.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, in order:
#
#   1. Reads the requirement named by --against out of the spec, VERBATIM.
#      Absent, superseded or withdrawn is a REFUSAL (4), never a warning: a
#      ruling against a dead requirement is a silent no-op that looks like
#      process.
#   2. Refuses (4) if a pending ruling already stands against that same
#      requirement. Two pending rulings on one requirement split the answer,
#      and whichever is ruled second is ruled against a spec the first already
#      moved.
#   3. Allocates the next D<n> from the rulings directory and the next C<n>
#      from the spec's *Areas of concern* table. max + 1, always - a gap is a
#      removed row, and filling it re-points every citation that named it.
#   4. Writes the ruling from templates/ruling.md with the header block, the
#      conflict, the question and both cost columns filled in.
#   5. Prints the path and the ids for the caller to name in the ask.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
#
#   No requirement id is allocated for the incoming behaviour. An id in the
#   spec is a merge, whatever the surrounding prose says - so allocating one
#   here would merge the losing side by accident.
#
#   The C<n> row is NOT added to the spec, and nothing is committed. This
#   script owns one file. Its caller adds the row and makes the single commit,
#   which is why the allocated C id is printed.
#
#   Nothing below `## Ruling` is filled. A human rules; the agent drafts every
#   section above that heading and none from there down. A stop that resolves
#   itself is not a stop.
#
# THE INTENT TEXT IS A STRANGER'S TEXT.
#
#   It is written INTO the ruling - that is the point of the file - but it is
#   never echoed on stdout or stderr, because those land in a model's context
#   before a human has read a word of them. `D7` cannot carry a sentence.
#   Inside the file it is quoted as a markdown blockquote, so no line of it can
#   forge a `Status:` header line for the pending-count to match, or a `##`
#   heading for a reader to trust.
#
# EXIT CODES ARE THE CONTRACT.
#
#   0  the ruling was written; its path and ids are on stdout
#   2  usage error - a missing, malformed or unknown argument
#   3  COULD NOT READ an input it needs: the spec, the rulings directory, the
#      intent file or the template. An unreadable rulings directory is NOT an
#      empty one: a repo with no rulings/ has never raised one and gets it
#      created; a directory that cannot be read is unknown, and allocating D1
#      into it would reuse every id already in there.
#   4  REFUSED - the requirement is absent, superseded or withdrawn, or a
#      pending ruling already stands against it.
