# .claude/hooks/publish-gate.sh — PreToolUse hook on the Bash tool.
#
# Stage 8 is agent-driven: the agent writes the post, writes the release email,
# captures the screenshots from the released build, and runs the pre-publish
# checks. This hook is the human gate on the last step — the one that puts any
# of it in front of people.
#
# Register it exactly as production-gate.sh is registered, matched to Bash:
#
#   "hooks": {
#     "PreToolUse": [{
#       "matcher": "Bash",
#       "hooks": [{ "type": "command",
#                   "command": ".claude/hooks/publish-gate.sh" }]
#     }]
#   }
#
# Exit codes are the contract:
#   2  BLOCKED. The command does not run; stderr goes back to the agent.
#   0  allowed.
# Every failure path exits 2, including this script's own bugs — a missing jq,
# an unexpected payload, an empty command. Claude Code runs the command anyway
# on any other non-zero status, so a gate that crashes with 1 or 127 is a gate
# that published. The EXIT trap rewrites anything that is not 0 or 2 into 2.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THIS IS A TEMPLATE. AN UNEDITED COPY GATES THE WRONG COMMANDS.
#
# The deny list below describes an imaginary team's publishing commands. Before
# it is worth committing:
#   1. Run the commands that actually publish for you past it, and watch them
#      exit 2.
#   2. Run drafting, screenshotting and preview commands past it, and watch
#      them exit 0. The agent must be able to do all of its own work.
#   3. Delete what does not apply and add what does.
# A gate never seen blocking a real publish is decoration.
#
# Why publishing is gated when the drafting is not: a post is indexed and
# forwarded within minutes, and mail cannot be recalled. Every other artifact
# in this lifecycle is a commit someone can revert. This one is not, and it
# carries claims about the product to people outside the team.

# --- normalising the command ----------------------------------------------
#
# The deny patterns are matched against a NORMALISED form of the command,
# never against the raw text. Raw-text matching is defeated by ordinary shell
# spellings - `npm "publish"`, `/usr/bin/npm publish`, `sh -c "npm publish"` -
# which are not attacks, just how commands get written. An agent emits the
# quoted form by accident. A gate that passes its own acceptance test and then
# fails on a pair of quotation marks is worse than no gate, because it is
# trusted.
#
# What the normaliser does, in order:
#   * splits the command on ; && || | & ( ) and newlines and judges EVERY
#     segment on its own, so `echo hi; ./deploy.sh prod` is judged twice;
#   * removes quoting and backslash escapes: `npm "publish"` -> `npm publish`;
#   * reduces argv[0] to its basename: /usr/bin/npm -> npm, ./deploy.sh -> deploy.sh;
#   * drops leading VAR=value assignments and interposer commands (sudo, env,
#     time, nohup, command, exec, xargs, stdbuf, nice, ionice, doas, setsid)
#     together with their own options, then judges what follows. `npx` and
#     `timeout <duration>` are treated the same way;
#   * unwraps `eval`, which is `sh -c` spelled shorter, and re-normalises what
#     it would have re-parsed;
#   * unwraps sh -c / bash -c / zsh -c and re-runs the whole normalisation on
#     the inner string, to GATE_MAX_DEPTH levels, BLOCKING if that is reached
#     rather than allowing;
#   * skips git's global options (-C dir, -c k=v, --git-dir=..., --no-pager,
#     ...) so that `git -C . push origin v1.2.3` reaches the push subcommand;
#   * flags a segment whose command word is a sensitive binary AND whose words
#     still contain a $expansion or a backtick. Variable indirection
#     (`p=publish; npm $p`) cannot be resolved without running the shell, so
#     the gate refuses instead of guessing. Failing closed on ambiguity is the
#     correct behaviour for a gate.

$1

Stage 8 drafts, a person decides, and then the agent runs it. This command
puts something in front of people, and neither a post nor an email can be
recalled - so the decision is a person's. The typing is not.

Before you ask, the pre-publish checklist has to actually pass:
  - every claim traces to a merged PR or a requirement id
  - every number was measured, and the measurement is stated
  - every screenshot came from THIS version's build
  - the version named is live and installable, and that was verified
  - no customer, repo, internal hostname or employer name appears anywhere,
    including in the screenshots
  - names and bylines of anyone credited are correct

Show the draft and the checklist results, say plainly which checks you could
not verify yourself, and ASK. On an explicit yes from the person - not an
inferred one, not silence, not a yes to some earlier question - run the command.
They should not have to retype a command they did not compose; making them do
that is how the approval turns into a chore and the chore turns into a rubber
stamp.

# --- asking a person, which is the half of R17 that did not exist -----------
#
# R17: "If a command would publish or deploy, then the gate shall block it
# UNTIL A PERSON DECIDES." Until now only the blocking half was built. There
# was no way to decide - not an env var, not a marker file, nothing - so the
# one remaining route was retyping the command in another shell, which the
# refusal text above argues against in its own words. It described the failure
# it caused.
#
# `permissionDecision: "ask"` routes to Claude Code's own permission prompt.
# That prompt is drawn by the harness and answered by a keystroke, so the agent
# this gate exists to constrain cannot draw it, answer it, or skip it. And the
# person approves the command already written rather than retyping it.
#
# THIS IS ONLY REACHED FOR A COMMAND THE GATE UNDERSTOOD. A command it could
# not parse or unwrap still hard-refuses above: asking a person to approve
# something nobody can read is not a decision, it is a signature on a blank
# page.
#
# TWO THINGS ARE DOCUMENTED AND ONE IS NOT, so this fails closed on the third.
#
#   Documented: "A hook that returns permissionDecision: \"deny\" blocks the
#   tool even in bypassPermissions mode or with --dangerously-skip-permissions."
#   That sentence names `deny`. It does NOT say the same of `ask`.
#
#   Documented: background subagents cannot show a prompt in non-interactive
#   mode.
#
#   NOT documented: what `ask` does under bypassPermissions, or in a plain `-p`
#   run. Nobody wrote it down, so this gate does not rely on it: anything other
#   than a mode known to prompt gets the hard refusal it got before. The gate
#   loses nothing it had; it only gains a path where one is known to work.

  # NOT `stat`. This used to try BSD `stat -f %m` and fall back to GNU
  # `stat -c %Y`, which is wrong in the one way a fallback cannot catch: on GNU
  # coreutils `-f` means FILESYSTEM status and SUCCEEDS, printing block counts
  # rather than a timestamp. The fallback never fired, the age arithmetic got a
  # non-number, and `set -e` killed the gate mid-decision. It was green on macOS
  # and red in CI, which is exactly the shape of bug a portability fallback is
  # supposed to prevent. Measured against a GNU-behaving shim, not reasoned.
  #
  # `find -mmin` is in both userlands and answers the only question being asked:
  # is this file younger than the limit. Minutes, so a sub-minute limit rounds
  # up to one rather than to zero - a limit of zero would refuse everything.

not be read. Either way it describes a state that has since moved. Re-run the

A \$expansion or a backtick decides what a publishing binary is asked to do,
and that is only known once the shell runs it. The gate cannot read it, so it
does not approve it - failing closed on ambiguity is the point of a gate.
Write the command out literally and it will be judged on what it says."
