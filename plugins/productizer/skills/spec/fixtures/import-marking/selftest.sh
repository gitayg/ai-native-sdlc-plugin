#
# The falsification suite for `check-import-marking.sh`, committed so it can be
# re-run rather than described. A check that has only ever been SEEN passing is
# not evidence; every case below was watched producing the wrong verdict under
# 1.0 before 1.1 was trusted, and this file is how anyone else watches it too.
#
# It builds throwaway git repositories in a temporary directory from the spec
# versions in `spec/`, runs the check against each, and compares the EXIT CODE
# and one load-bearing line of output against what that history should produce.
# Nothing is written into the repository this file lives in.
#
# THE THREE STATES R10 HAS TO KEEP APART, and the case that proves each:
#
#   1-never-imported.md        no marker, no `Stage 0c`, one change-log row per
#                              requirement. There is no import here, so there
#                              is nothing to assert - exit 2, UNMEASURED.
#                              UNDER 1.0 THIS EXITED 0.
#   2-import-marked-none.md    1 with the four rows collapsed into one row
#                              naming `Stage 0c`, and NOT ONE requirement
#                              marked. The complete violation - exit 1.
#                              UNDER 1.0 THIS EXITED 0, because every cohort
#                              anchored on a marker and there was none.
#   4-import-marked-some.md    2 with three of the four marked. The partial
#                              violation 1.0 already caught - exit 1, and it
#                              must print DIFFERENTLY from case 2.
#   3-import-marked-all.md     2 with all four settled: three marked inferred,
#                              one refused at import - exit 0. The positive
#                              control. Without it a check that failed
#                              everything would pass this suite.
#   6-import-promoted.md       2 with nothing marked and a decision-record row
#                              confirming all four. Promotion DELETES the
#                              marker, so a ratified import is bare by design
#                              and must not be a finding.
#   5-import-silent...md       2 with `Stage 0c` removed from the row. Nothing
#                              marked, no stage named, so nothing distinguishes
#                              it from a repository that never imported - exit
#                              2, UNMEASURED. THIS IS THE DECLARED HOLE, and it
#                              is a case so that the hole is measured rather
#                              than asserted.
#   5 + a commit message       5 again, committed with `Stage 0c` in the COMMIT
#                              MESSAGE. Marker-free detection with the spec
#                              itself silent - exit 1, four findings.
#   5 + the backlog            5 again, with `backlog/with-stage-0c.md` in
#                              place. The stage is named in the backlog and
#                              nowhere else, which is the evidence step 5 of
#                              the import procedure leaves behind - so the
#                              import is on the record, and the cohort cannot
#                              be resolved from it. Exit 2, and it prints as
#                              COHORT UNRESOLVED, not as "no import".
#
# EXIT CODES ARE THE CONTRACT.
#
#   0  every case produced the verdict it should
#   1  a case produced the wrong verdict - the check is not measuring what it
#      says it measures, whatever it reports against the real spec
#   2  could not run - no git, no check to test, no temporary directory
