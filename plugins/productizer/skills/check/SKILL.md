## Reading that

The runner already says most of what matters. Add only what it cannot:

- **`REFUSED` is not `FAIL`.** A refused check did not run — a missing tool, an
  unreadable config, a coverage assertion it could not satisfy. Report it as
  unmeasured, never fold it into a pass or a failure count.
- **`HOLLOW` means it exited clean having examined less than it declared.** That
  is a failure, and it usually means the check was handed the wrong input rather
  than that the code is wrong. Check the changed-file list before blaming it.
- **`not_triggered` is not a problem** for a scoped check whose paths this change
  did not touch. It is a problem for one declared `always`.
- **`spec coverage: UNMEASURED`** is the honest state when no check names a
  requirement. Do not describe it as a failure.

If the run refused, say what would make it runnable. Do not re-run with a
narrower input to get a green — a smaller question answered is not the question
that was asked.
