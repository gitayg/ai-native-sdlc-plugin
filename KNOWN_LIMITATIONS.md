# Known limitations

What Productizer's mechanisms cannot do, written down so nobody has to
rediscover it. Everything here was reproduced, not reasoned about; where a
limitation has a reproduction it is given in full, and where a claim was **not**
tested it says so.

This file is worth having only if it is true. Add to it when you find something;
do not remove an entry because it is unflattering.

Measured on git 2.50.1 (Apple Git-155), macOS, 2026-08-29.

## Requirement traceability — `Productizer-Req:` and `COV_` ids

Convention and commands: `plugins/productizer/skills/spec/references/traceability.md`.

### 1 · `git commit --amend -m` destroys the trailer

The most important one, and the reason this file exists.

`--amend -m` replaces the commit message wholesale. The `prepare-commit-msg`
hook does fire, but git hands it exactly the same arguments as an ordinary
`-m` commit, so **the hook cannot tell an amend from a first commit** and cannot
safely recover the old message. Measured:

```
git commit -m "..."          ->  hook argv: ($1=.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG, $2=message)
git commit --amend -m "..."  ->  hook argv: ($1=.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG, $2=message)
git commit --amend           ->  hook argv: ($1=.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG, $2=commit, $3=HEAD)
```

Only the third form carries a distinguishing argument — and that form does not
need it, because git seeds the editor with the old message, trailer included.

The tempting fix is for the hook to read `HEAD`'s trailer and re-apply it. It is
wrong: on a plain `-m` commit that same code copies the **parent commit's** ids
onto an unrelated change. A provenance record that is confidently wrong is worse
than one that is missing, so the hook does not do it.

**Reproduction**

```
$ PRODUCTIZER_REQ=R1 git commit -q -m "a change that serves R1"
prepare-commit-msg: Productizer-Req: R1  (from $PRODUCTIZER_REQ)

$ git log -1 --format=%B
a change that serves R1

Productizer-Req: R1

$ git commit --amend -q -m "reworded, and the provenance is gone"
prepare-commit-msg: no requirement id found in $PRODUCTIZER_REQ or the branch
name, so this commit will carry no Productizer-Req trailer.

$ git log -1 --format=%B
reworded, and the provenance is gone

$ req-trailer.sh --validate --rev HEAD
req-trailer: CANNOT DETERMINE — commit HEAD carries no 'Productizer-Req:' trailer.
There is nothing to validate. An absent trailer is not a valid one — it is an
untraced change.
$ echo $?
4
```

**Mitigations, all three reproduced**

1. **Name the ids on the amend.** The hook puts them straight back.

   ```
   $ PRODUCTIZER_REQ=R1 git commit --amend -q -m "reworded, provenance restored"
   prepare-commit-msg: Productizer-Req: R1  (from $PRODUCTIZER_REQ)
   $ req-trailer.sh --validate --rev HEAD
   req-trailer: commit HEAD — 1 cited id(s) all exist in .claude/productizer/spec.md (3 active, 1 superseded, 1 withdrawn on file).
   $ echo $?
   0
   ```

2. **Put the id in the branch name.** Then no environment variable is needed and
   the amend repairs itself, every time, for everyone on that branch.

   ```
   $ git branch -m fix/R1-branch-carries-the-id
   $ git commit --amend -q -m "reworded again, no env var this time"
   prepare-commit-msg: Productizer-Req: R1  (from branch 'fix/R1-branch-carries-the-id')
   ```

3. **Amend without `-m`.** `git commit --amend` opens the editor pre-filled with
   the old message; the trailer is already there and nothing is lost. Verified
   on a branch whose name held no id and with `$PRODUCTIZER_REQ` unset.

The backstop for all three is `req-trailer.sh --validate` in a pre-push hook or
in CI. It exits 4 — *cannot determine*, not *pass* — on a commit with no
trailer, so a silently amended-away trailer fails the check instead of passing
it.

### 2 · A squash merge hides the trailer from git's own trailer parser

`git merge --squash` (and GitHub's "Squash and merge") concatenates the messages
it swallows and **indents every line by four spaces**. The trailer text survives,
but it is no longer in the trailer block, so git stops treating it as a trailer:

```
$ git log -1 --format='%(trailers:key=Productizer-Req,valueonly)'
                      <- empty
$ git log -1 --format=%B | git interpret-trailers --parse
                      <- empty
$ git log --grep='^Productizer-Req:' --format='%h %s'
                      <- no match: the ^ anchor fails on an indented line
$ git log --grep='Productizer-Req:' --format='%h %s'
3bca457 Squashed commit of the following:
```

`req-trailer.sh` handles this — it strips leading whitespace before matching,
and its `--grep` filter is deliberately **not** anchored — and a squashed commit
validates correctly:

```
$ req-trailer.sh --validate --rev HEAD
req-trailer: commit HEAD — 3 cited id(s) all exist in .claude/productizer/spec.md (3 active, 1 superseded, 1 withdrawn on file).
```

But anything else you point at these commits will not. `%(trailers:…)` in a
`git log` format, `git interpret-trailers --parse`, a forge's trailer UI, and any
`^`-anchored grep all come up empty on a squash-merged commit. If your project
squash-merges, drop the `^` from every hand-written query.

Not tested: GitHub's server-side squash-merge specifically. The local
`git merge --squash` above is a proxy for it, and GitHub's default squash message
is built the same way, but that is an inference, not a measurement.

### 3 · Only HEAD's ancestry is searched

`--query` and `--orphans` run `git log HEAD`. A commit that exists only on an
unmerged branch, only on a remote that has not been fetched, or only in someone
else's clone is invisible, and the requirement it claims is reported as
orphaned. Reproduced simply by running `--orphans` on `main` and on a feature
branch and getting different answers:

```
$ git checkout main && req-trailer.sh --orphans
History: walked 5 commit(s) of HEAD; 2 carry a Productizer-Req trailer; 2 distinct id(s) claimed.
ORPHANED — active, and no commit claims it (2):
  R2
  R5

$ git checkout clean-history && req-trailer.sh --orphans
History: walked 6 commit(s) of HEAD; 3 carry a Productizer-Req trailer; 3 distinct id(s) claimed.
Every active requirement is claimed by at least one commit, and every claimed id
exists. Measured from the counts above.
```

Both answers are correct for the history they were asked about. Neither is a
statement about the project. Every report prints how many commits it walked, so
a number that came from a truncated history can be spotted — but the tool cannot
tell a **shallow clone** from a genuinely short history, and does not try.

### 4 · A rebase or cherry-pick multiplies the claims

Trailers survive `git rebase`, `git cherry-pick` and `git format-patch | git am`
— all three reproduced, each producing a new sha with an identical trailer:

```
before rebase:      33c0bac  Productizer-Req: R2,R5
after  rebase:      db24bed  Productizer-Req: R2,R5
after  cherry-pick: 8ae08b1  Productizer-Req: R2,R5
```

Which means the commit count in `--query` counts **commits, not units of work**.
After a rebase that duplicated a commit onto a branch you still have, one change
reads as two:

```
$ req-trailer.sh --query R1
R1 — active
3 commit(s) carry this id. Walked 8 commit(s); 5 carry a Productizer-Req trailer; git log --grep matched 5.

  d1b87f55b2e3  2026-08-29 08:14:22 UTC  cover the requirements
  24301111e71b  2026-08-29 08:11:43 UTC  hold exactly one living spec
  78b1782941d9  2026-08-29 08:11:43 UTC  hold exactly one living spec
```

Read that number as "at least one commit claims this", never as an amount of
work done.

### 5 · The coverage scan is textual, so documentation counts as coverage

`--coverage` greps tracked files for `COV_R<n>…`. It has no idea whether the
token it found is a test, a comment, a design note, or a sentence about the
convention itself. Found the hard way: the first version of `req-trailer.sh`
carried `COV_R14_contradiction_halts` as an example in its own header, and

- in a repo that had vendored the script, that example was reported as a
  **dangling** coverage id (the fixture spec had no R14), and
- in the Productizer repo, where R14 **does** exist, the same example would have
  been reported as genuine coverage of R14 — a false pass, which is the
  direction that matters.

```
DANGLING — a COV_ identifier names an id the spec does not contain (1):
  COV_R14_contradiction_halts   .claude/productizer/bin/req-trailer.sh  (no such requirement)
```

`req-trailer.sh` now carries no literal `COV_R<n>` token anywhere, verified:

```
$ grep -c -E 'COV_R[0-9]+' scripts/req-trailer.sh
0
```

`references/traceability.md` still does, on purpose — a convention document has
to show the convention — and says so in the document. So does this file. If
either is copied into a repository being scanned, it registers as coverage of
the requirements it names; measured, by copying both into a fixture tree:

```
DANGLING — a COV_ identifier names an id the spec does not contain (5):
  COV_R14_                        docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md  (no such requirement)
  COV_R14_contradiction_halts     docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md  (no such requirement)
  COV_R14_halts_on_contradiction  docs/traceability.md       (no such requirement)
  COV_R16_unmeasured_is_not_zero  docs/traceability.md       (no such requirement)
  COV_R99_this_id_never_existed   tests/test_spec.py         (no such requirement)
```

They show as *dangling* there only because that fixture's spec has no R14 or
R16. In this repository both ids exist, so the same tokens would be reported as
genuine **coverage** — the false pass, not the noisy false alarm.

There is no exclusion mechanism. Adding one means adding a way to mark a token
"not real", which is a way to mark a real gap "covered". Reading the file path
in the report is cheaper and harder to abuse.

### 6 · Gitignored trees are not scanned

`--coverage` uses `git ls-files` by default, so anything gitignored is invisible
and the search silently shrinks to fit. The report always names which list it
used (`git ls-files (gitignored files NOT scanned)` / `find`). Pass
`--include-ignored` to walk with `find` instead. Same blind spot, same flag, and
the same reasoning as `scripts/drift-reverse.sh`.

### 7 · The trailer is a claim, not evidence

Nothing checks that a commit citing R14 has anything to do with R14. Nothing
checks that a `COV_R14_…` test runs, passes, or exercises the behaviour R14
describes. A commit can claim every id in the spec and satisfy `--orphans`
completely.

These are pointers for a reader, in the same spirit as `drift-reverse.sh`: they
find the places worth reading and refuse to call the rest clean. Treating a
green `--orphans` as evidence of implemented requirements is a misreading the
tool cannot prevent.

### 8 · `--add` validates only when it can reach the spec

Run outside a repository that has `.claude/productizer/spec.md`, `--add` writes
the trailer without checking the ids exist, so the hook keeps working in a repo
that has not been scaffolded yet. When the spec **is** reachable it refuses an
unknown id and leaves the message file byte-for-byte unmodified:

```
$ req-trailer.sh --add R99 --file msg.txt
req-trailer: refusing to write a trailer naming an id that
.claude/productizer/spec.md does not contain:
  R99 — not in the spec
The commit message was NOT modified.
$ echo $?
3
```

### 9 · `.git/hooks/` is not cloned

The hook is a file in `.git/`, so it is not committed, not cloned, and not
distributed. Every developer installs it themselves, and a fresh clone has no
trailer automation until they do. `core.hooksPath` pointed at a tracked
directory solves this repo-wide; it is a repo-level decision this skill does not
make for you. Not implemented, not tested.

### 10 · Not proven

Stated for completeness — these were **not** measured:

- GitHub / GitLab server-side squash-merge and rebase-merge message formats.
- `git filter-branch` / `git filter-repo` rewrites.
- Behaviour on git older than 2.50.1. `git interpret-trailers` (used by `--add`)
  has existed since 2.1 and `--if-exists replace` since 2.4, but no older
  version was run.
- Windows, and any non-UTF-8 commit message encoding.
- Repositories large enough for the single `git log` pass in `--orphans` to be
  slow. It reads every commit message in HEAD's ancestry, once, with no limit.
