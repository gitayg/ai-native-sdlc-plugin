The reply must end with `VERDICT: CONTRADICT`.

This is the recall criterion. It carries 10 of the 25 scored weight points in
this case, and together with the halt criterion beside it 16 of 25 — 64 percent
of the score, against the 43 percent the mirror-image criterion carries in a
must-not-halt case. A run that
explains the conflict beautifully and then classifies the intent as an extend
has shipped a conflicting requirement, which is the failure this corpus exists
to measure. Missing critical information is worse than including extra
information: an over-cautious halt costs a human a minute, a missed
contradiction costs a spec that is confidently wrong.

Conflict under test: P3 says a closed account is never charged and R2 stops charging at the end of the cancelled cycle. The intent does not mention charging a closed account — it asks for minimum-term recovery — but recovering the term from a closed account is a charge on a closed account, which is the step that has to be taken to see it.
