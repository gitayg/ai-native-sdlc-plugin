The reply must end with `VERDICT: CONTRADICT`.

This is the recall criterion. It carries 10 of the 25 scored weight points in
this case, and together with the halt criterion beside it 16 of 25 — 64 percent
of the score, against the 43 percent the mirror-image criterion carries in a
must-not-halt case. A run that
explains the conflict beautifully and then classifies the intent as an extend
has shipped a conflicting requirement, which is the failure this corpus exists
to measure. Missing critical information is worse than including extra
information: an over-cautious halt costs a human a minute, a missed
contradiction costs a spec that is confidently wrong.

Conflict under test: R5's 99.9 percent of a calendar month is about 43 minutes of downtime; 90 minutes of planned maintenance per month is roughly 99.79 percent. The two bounds are on the same quantity in different units, so neither number can be compared to the other without converting a percentage into minutes first.
